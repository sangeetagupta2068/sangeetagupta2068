<p align="center">I am passionate about building sustainable tech ecosystems and advocate for the growth of women in technology. I lead Facebook Developer Circles, Pune and have built a vibrant ecosystem of 6K+ aspiring and experienced local developers who are looking out to build new skills, grow ideas and boost their careers in technology. In 2018, I received the AnitaB.org Grace Hopper Celebration India Scholarship for exhibiting strong leadership and technical skills. For my strong beliefs of giving back to my roots, I served as an educator for information and communication technology to over 50 children with multiple disabilities in Assam. Currently, I am pursuing my MSc in Computer Applications at Symbiosis International (Deemed) University and looking to connect with people who share the same interest of growing, scaling and building communities!</p>
